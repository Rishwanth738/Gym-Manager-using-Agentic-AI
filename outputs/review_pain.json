Potentially also caused by hitting hand into a door earlier in the day.","treatment_recommendations":"**Elbow Pain during Shoulder Press:**\nIt's crucial to address this sharp elbow pain immediately, especially since it started during your workout and potentially exacerbated by an earlier impact. The elbow is a complex joint, and pain during overhead movements can indicate several issues, including tendon irritation or strain.\n\n1.  **Immediate Action & Rest:** Since the pain was sharp and sustained, you must prioritize rest for your right elbow. Avoid any exercises that aggravate the pain, especially overhead movements and activities that involve direct impact or twisting of the arm. Do not push through the pain.\n2.  **R.I.C.E. Protocol:**\n    *   **Rest:** Absolutely avoid activities that cause pain.\n    *   **Ice:** Apply an ice pack to your elbow for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours to reduce inflammation and pain.\n    *   **Compression:** A light compression bandage might help reduce swelling, but ensure it's not too tight.\n    *   **Elevation:** Elevate your arm when resting to help with swelling.\n3.  **Gentle Stretches & Mobility:** Once the acute pain subsides slightly, very gentle stretches for the forearm and elbow can help maintain mobility. Do not force any movement that causes pain.\n4.  **Form Review for Shoulder Press:** If the pain was indeed aggravated by the shoulder press, it's vital to review your form. Ensure your grip is appropriate, your wrists are neutral, and you're not locking out your elbows forcefully at the top. Keeping your elbows slightly bent at the top can reduce stress. Also, ensure your shoulder stability is adequate for overhead movements.\n5.  **Consult a Professional:** Given the sharpness of the pain and the potential impact injury, if the pain does not significantly improve with rest and ice within a couple of days, or if it worsens, please consult a medical professional (doctor or physical therapist). It's important to rule out any more serious injury.\n\n**Communication to Trainer:**\n\"Trainer, please note that Rishwanth experienced sharp pain in his right elbow today during shoulder press, which continued throughout the session. This might be related to an earlier impact injury to his hand. I have advised him to rest, apply ice, and avoid any aggravating exercises. Please adjust his upcoming workout plan to completely exclude any exercises that put direct stress on the elbow, especially overhead presses and any heavy lifting involving the arm, until his pain resolves and he has been cleared by a medical professional if necessary. We need to prioritize his recovery to prevent further injury.\"","youtube_links":["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5yr4HNfQ-8","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AuHxQ2Dabc","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFNhlBR-Ae0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_P64Xs8Jmk","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlFGTI5JzjI"]}
